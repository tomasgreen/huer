(hue +â€Ž -er) One who cries out or gives an alarm

Dependency free JavaScript modal library that can be used as an alert view replacement.


## Todo

- [ ] `position: fixed` works just fine when the view didn't support for input fields, but with iOS 8 an alternate method of positioning the body is needed: `position: absolute` with js calculations and a resize event.
- [ ] Enable scrolling of the container so that the body can overflow the viewport (bootstrap style).
